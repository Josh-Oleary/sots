                <p class="card-text">I’m a landscape, sports and commercial photographer based in Nelson BC. My love of photography is driven by the power and emotion that it can convey in all walks of life, not just in the snow. I’m happiest behind the camera, and though you won’t be able to see it there will be a smile on my face. Though I consider myself a professional and care deeply about the work I help produce I always try to consciously make an effort not to take life too seriously. I love the work SOTS is putting together and it’s great to be part of such a cool team.</p>

She was raised on the slopes of Whistler Blackcomb, instructed at Grouse Mountain for six years, and fell in love with the Fernie champagne powder. Her love for skiing took her to Austria where she studied Alpine Tourism and to Japan where she lived out her JAPOW dreams. State of the Snowpack is a passion project that she is stoked to be part of and help bring it to other mountain towns!</p>
